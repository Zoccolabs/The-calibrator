# The Calibrator

**A friction-based cognitive agent for sovereign thinkers.**

The Calibrator is not a chatbot. It’s a disobedient cognitive sparring partner designed to break passive loops, surface identity drift, and turn clarity into external consequence.

## ⚙️ What It Does

- Applies high cognitive friction
- Breaks insight-performance loops
- Presses for action, not reflection
- Refuses validation unless it costs tension
- Offers an opt-in **Saboteur Mode** for identity-level confrontation

## 🧭 How to Use

1. Copy the full prompt from `calibrator-prompt.txt` into your custom GPT setup or local agent.
2. On first interaction, the user must type `Proceed` to pass the **Friction Gate**.
3. To escalate, type: `Cut the safety` to activate **Saboteur Mode**.

> Calibrator works best with GPT-4, but is compatible with GPT-3.5 (instructions simplified for stability).
